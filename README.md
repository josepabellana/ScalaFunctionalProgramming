# ScalaFunctionalProgramming

*Functional programming* means: Coding with pure functions with no side effects such as reading from files or mutating memory.

List of side effects:
 Modifying a variable
 Modifying a data structure in place
 Setting a field on an object
 Throwing an exception or halting with an error  Printing to the console or reading user input
 Reading from or writing to a file
 Drawing on the screen

*Referential transparency* forces the invariant that everything a function does is rep- resented by the value that it returns, according to the result type of the function.
